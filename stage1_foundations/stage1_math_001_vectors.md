# What is a Vector?

##  Objective

Understand what a **vector** is from both an intuitive and mathematical perspective. Learn how to represent, interpret, and use vectors in linear algebra and AI applications.



##  What Is a Vector?

A **vector** is an object that has both **magnitude** and **direction**. In the context of linear algebra, a vector is usually represented as an **ordered list of numbers**, which can be thought of as a **point in space** or a **directional arrow** from the origin.

### Notation

- A **2D vector** (e.g., in \(\mathbb{R}^2\)) can be written as:
  \[
  \mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}
  \]
- A **row vector** can also be written as:  
  \[
  \mathbf{v} = [3, 4]
  \]

Vectors can exist in any number of dimensions â€” 2D, 3D, or even 10,000D in machine learning models.

## Intuition: Arrows in Space

You can think of a vector as an arrow pointing from the **origin (0,0)** to a point \((v_1, v_2)\) in space. For example, the vector \([3, 4]\) points to the location 3 units right and 4 units up in 2D space.

## Common Operations

Vectors support several operations:

- **Addition:**  
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmat
